# Integrated-Quantum
The quantum physics app!

This is not just a normal app. Integrated Quantum also contains an algorithm to solve the schr√∂dinger equation numerically(currently only available for a 1D symmetric potential).


If you want to download the app you can do it here(the file usually includes the latest pull requests I made):

If you want to test changes you made you will need to do the following steps:

1: Install android studio(https://developer.android.com/studio/).

2: Create a new project and use 16 as minimum SDK-version

3: Replace the auto generated AndroidManifest with the one that can be downloaded here.

4: Run the app on an emulator or your device.
