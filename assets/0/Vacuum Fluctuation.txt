[t]Vacuum fluctuations are small changes in the energy of space. They are created by the uncertainty of time and energy(see "Uncertainty Principle"). This energy fluctuation creates antiparticle-particle pairs of virtual particles which eliminate each other normally (for exceptions see "Hawking Radiation") fast and the vacuum energy returns to its base value. These virtual particles can affect real particles (e.g. charge of electrons) which gives us the chance to prove the existence of virtual particles. Fluctuations are best measurable in vacuum because there the mass of the system (and so the energy which has a density of 0.6eVcm^-3  in vacuum) is much smaller and the uncertainty gets bigger. Vacuum fluctuation may be responsible for the expansion of our universe and may be the explanation for the value of the cosmological constant. The existence of vacuum fluctuations can be proved using the Casimir effect. The Casimir effect can occur between two plates of a conductive material in vacuum without any force between them and no fields in surrounding (including electromagnetic waves). The distance between the plates must be around 100nm because at bigger values the effect is not measurable. Due to the Casimir effect these plates attract each other. One possible explanation are vacuum fluctuations which create virtual particles. Particles inside the plates can only have small wavelength, so they are created less often (because low wavelength particles need more energy). So outside the plates is a higher pressure than inside which creates work moving the plates together.[\]
