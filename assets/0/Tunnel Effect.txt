[t]The Tunnel effect is an effect that occurs to a particle near a potential barrier. The potential energy of the barrier can be bigger than the kinetic energy of the particle, but on the other side of the barrier has to be a region with lower potential. A big amplitude of the wave function gets reflected from the barrier, but a small fraction is able to tunnel through the barrier. So a particle is able to go through any non-finite barrier. The simplest example for the Tunnel effect is a particle moving straight in one direction, towards a barrier of defined length and constant potential bigger than the particles energy. The following graph shows the real(green) and the imaginary(blue) part of an example wave function of a particle traveling through a potential barrier:[\]

[t]There is ĦTunnel EffectĦ2Ħanother chapterĦ in which we calculate the wave function for the tunnel effect.\
The Tunnel Effect only applies to small particles. For example protons in our sun are tunneling through the potential barrier around another proton which leads to nuclear fusion. For bigger masses the chance to tunnel through the barrier gets negligible. The Tunnel effect is also applied in microscopy. For further information see "Scanning Probe Microscopy(WIP)".[\]
