[t] As an introduction to the wavefunction we may have a quick reconciliation on the wave-model. So the first part that was introduced was the wavelength, it basically meant, that there was an uncertainty of the position of the quantum object, the physical meaning of this concept is that the quantum object was delocalized in a sphere defined by the wavelength. However now things have changed, in both directions. \
On one side we now can give clearer information about the position of the quantum object in the sphere. On the other side we have clarified that there is a small but existing probability that the quantum object is found outside of the sphere. \
The wavefunction is usually written as &Y(x, y, z, t) or just as a function of a selected amount of those variables. It is the core of quantum theory and it is the function which is the solution to the ĦSchrödinger EquationĦ2ĦSchroedinger-equationĦ. One can express its most important meaning very simply by stating: [\]

[f] ∫|&Y(x, y, z, t)|^2 *d&t = p(x, y, z, t) [\]

[t] In this context p is the probability of finding a particle in a certain region in the space-time-continuum defined by the borders of the integral. &t is just an infinitesimal element of space.\
As you might have noticed by now (while reading articles of this app) quantum physics is non-deterministic. So there is no way for you, or anybody to calculate where exactly a particle (or other quantum object) will be. And that has nothing to do with a lack of information. \
As far as I am concerned there is just no way to know this. The problem is the only thing the equations of quantum physics (mainly the Schroedinger-equation) do not tell us exactly how the universe is. But what they tell us, is that it is unclear. There may be some equations one day that tell us how exactly the universe is. But in this moment we do not know. \
And maybe the position is just not determined yet, so in the instance of time you measure the position of a particle is set and before that the position is not only unknown to you but also not there. But this is just one ĦInterpretationsĦ2ĦinterpretationĦ of the equations. \
One small excurse would be to mention the most famous use of the wavefunction and the schroedinger equation: ĦAtomic OrbitalsĦ0ĦWIPĦ. \
If we would just have the wavelength it would be enough to say, that the electron is inside a specific orbital, but with the wavefunction that just is not the whole truth as there is a 10% chance for it to be outside. [\]
