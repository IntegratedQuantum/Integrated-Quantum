[t]As we see on the chart of the standard model there are fermions and bosons. Fermions "are" the matter and bosons just transmitt the 4 elementary forces (the one that isn't on the chart is gravity,  and it's boson the graviton, which is a hypothetical particle). The standard model is not considering antimatter or dark matter.\\
For example the leptons in the upper row share similar properties but (as obvious) do not have the same mass. The same applies to the second row and the quarks. The particles can build bigger particles together, the two most famous examples are the proton and the neutron, which are both built of 3 quarks. The proton is built of two up quarks and one down quark, as easy to calculate it has the charge of 1. The neutron is built of two down quarks and one up quark and has no charge. As we can easily calculate with the chart, the neutron has more mass than a proton.\\
We can divide the subatomic particles into fermions, bosons and hadrons. Hadrons are the composite of quarks and are held together by the strong nuclear force. We can divide them into baryons, such as protons and neutrons, which are particles out of 3 quarks and into mesons, a meson is made of one quark and it's antiquark. Baryons have half-integer spins, while mesons have integer spins. Nucleons are not the only baryons we know, there are also a lot of other baryons.[\]
