[t]The pauli exclusion principle is influencing the atomic theory really strong. It was created in 1925  by the austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli. It states, that all quantum objects in one quantum system can not match in all four quantum numbers. So to be clear we take the orbitals as examples of quantum systems and all electrons in one orbital have to have the same principal quantum number n, the same azimuthal quantum number l and the same magnetic quantum number m. So the only quantum number in which we can separate the electrons is the spin quantum number s. \ 
But while the spin of an electron is either ½ or -½ at most two electrons can be in one orbital.\
In fact this is one of the reason why there are orbitals in atoms and not orbits (atomic theory by Niels Bohr). The other is the "Uncertainty Principle" (see "Uncertainty Principle"): \ 
To express this phenomena in quantum physical "language" we can say, that the wavefunctions of the fermions in the system have to be antisymmetric to each other. One starting point for this principle is the fact, that if we exchange two (really) identical fermions just the compute-sign in front of the function changes (the function gets antisymmetrical), but if we do the same thing to bosons nothing changes with the wavefunction. So as we see here the pauli exclusion does not apply to bosons.\
This means, that the wavefunction of a whole quantum system (not necessary an atomic orbital) including n identical fermions has to be totally antisymmetric (so the absolute value of the function stays the same) to every exchange (permutation) P you make with two particles.[\]
