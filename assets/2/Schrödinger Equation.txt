[t]The schrödinger equation is a differential equation which is used to calculate the wave function of a quantum object. There are 2 different types of schrödinger equations: time dependend and time independent. The time independent equation is used to describe systems where the energy doesn't depend on the time(like a single electron orbiting an atom). The time independent schrödinger equation is easier to solve. The time independent equation looks like this:\[\]
	[f]{-ħ^2 }/{2m} ∇^2 Ψ + VΨ = EΨ[\]
[t]∇^2 (nabla square) is a variable depending on the dimension. In one dimension it is:\[\]
	[f]∇^2  = {d^2 }/{dx^2 }[\]
[t]In 3 dimensions it is:\[\]
	[f]∇^2  = {∂^2 }/{∂x^2 } + {∂^2 }/{∂y^2 } + {∂^2 }/{∂z^2 }[\]
[t]∂ indicates that its a partial derivative. The schrödinger equation also can be time depended(where V and Ψ are function of the time):\[\]
	[f]iħ {∂Ψ}/{∂t} = {-ħ^2 }/{2m} ∇^2 Ψ + VΨ[\]
[t]The time dependent equation can be used to calculate particles in a time dependent potential. All these equations are nonrelativistic. There is a part of quantum mechanics which implements relativistic behaviour of particles. We won't show relativistic quantum mechanics in this app because that would need an additional topic about the theory of relativity.[\]
[t]The schrödinger equation is sometimes also shown as:[\]
	[f]³HΨ = EΨ[\]
[t]³H is the Hamiltonoperator which is defined as:[\]
	[f]³H = {-ħ^2 }/{2m} ∇^2  + V[\]
