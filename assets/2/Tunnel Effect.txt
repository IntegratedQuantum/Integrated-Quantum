[t]The function of potential can be divided into 3 sections of Ħconstant PotentialĦ2Ħconstant potentialĦ. The constant in the first and second wave function can be formed by assuming a potential of zero:[\]
	[f]Ψ_1 = Ae^ikx +Be^-ikx [\]
	[f]k = {(2mE_kin )^0.5 }/{ħ}[\]
[t]In the barrier the potential is bigger than the particles energy. So the term (E-V) gets negative. Because of that the term in the root gets negative. Now we can include the i which is in the exponent of the general solution into the root and the minus is removed. This leads to a simpler exponential function:[\]
	[f]Ψ_2  = Ce^cx +De^-cx [\]
	[f]c = {-(2m(E-V))^0.5 }/{ħ}[\]
[t]The third function is again in an area with no potential. So the constant k is still the same as in "1". Therefor the function is the same with new constants E and F:[\]
	[f]Ψ_3  = Ee^ikx +Fe^-ikx [\]
[t]Now there are 6 unknown constants. The total wave function and its first derivative function must be continuous which is important at the walls of the barrier(x_1  = 0, x_2  = l). So there are 4 equation that must be true:[\]
	[f]A+B = C+D[\]
	[f]Ce^cl +De^-cl  = Ee^ikl +Fe^-ikl [\]
	[f]ikA-ikB = cC-cD[\]
	[f]cCe^cl -cDe^-cl  = ikEe^ikl -ikFe^-ikl [\]
[t]The term Fe^-ikx  just means a movement to negative x. Since in the region of x > l there is now further wave-source or barrier that would explain a wave moving in negative x-direction the constant F = 0. So there are only 5 constants that must get solved with four equation which is impossible. So another condition is needed.\
Every wave function needs to be normalized to ensure an overall probability amplitude of 1. If you have a function whose amplitude does not converge to 0 for x → ∞ or x → -∞ then you can either normalize a small interval or just choose one of the 5 constants.\
The Tunnel chance is proportional to |A|^2 *|E|^-2  and reduces exponentially with the width of the barrier and the square root of the mass of the particle.[\]
