[t]The finite potential well can be solved by dividing the total area in 3 different wave function in a constant potential. The potential outside the well has to be greater then the particles energy. Otherwise there would be no discrete energy levels. These wave functions are given by the general solution of the Schrödinger equation. The constant of the wave functions of high potential include the "i" for reasons of simplification:[\]
[f]Ψ_1  = Ae^cx  + Be^-cx [\]
[f]Ψ_2  = Ce^ikx  + De^-ikx [\]
[f]Ψ_3  = Ee^cx  + Fe^-cx [\]
[f]k = {(2m(E-V))^0.5 }/{ħ}[\]
[f]c = {(-2m(E-V))^0.5 }/{ħ} = {(2m(V-E))^0.5 }/{ħ}[\]
[t]The positive exponents describe a movement in positive x-direction, the negative exponents describe a movement in negative x-direction. In the quantum well the particle can move in both directions because it gets reflected from the potential barriers, but since the barriers don't end, the particle will never get reflected inside the barriers and move only in the direction they entered the barrier. So the constants A and F are 0:
[f]→ Ψ_1  = Be^-cx [\]
[f]→ Ψ_3  = Ee^cx [\]
[t]Because we always need a harmonic(continuous and continuously differentiable) wave function the wave functions must be equal and have an equal derivative at the point of transition(x_1→2  = 0; x_2→3  = L) between 2 of the defined wave functions:[\]
[f]Be^-c*0  = Ce^ik*0  + De^-ik*0 [\]
[f]→ B = C + D[\]
[f]-cBe^-c*0  = ikCe^ik0  - ikDe^-ik*0 [\]
[f]→ -cB = ikC - ikD[\]
[f]Ee^cL  = Ce^ikL  + De^-ikL [\]
[f]cEe^cL  = ikCe^ikL  - ikDe^-ikL [\]
[t]But there is also a fifth condition: normalization. So the energy cannot be chosen freely. So again there will be several discrete energy levels for a particle in a finite potential well. Since the energy is part of c and k there no way to extract the energy from one of the previous equations. Also the normalization formula contains k and c in the exponents and in front of the exponential functions, so there is no way to extract the energy from any of the necessary equations. So there is (at least now) no way to solve this problem without using a numerical approximation. Fortunately this app also includes the function to numerically solve the schrödinger equation for specific potentials(WIP).[\]
