[t]Complex numbers are compositions of complex and real numbers:[\]
	[f]z = a+bi[\]
[t]a and b are real numbers, z is a complex number. a is callled real part of z(Re(z) = a) and b is called imaginary part of z(Im(z) = b). If a = 0 z is an imaginary number and if b = 0 z is a real number. You can bascially calculate with complex numbers like with real numbers:[\]
	[f]z_1 +z_2  = a_1 +a_2 +(b_1 +b_2 )i[\]
	[f]z_1 *z_2  = a_1 a_2 -b_1 b_2 +(a_1 b_2 +a_2 b_1 )i[\]
[t]Division and subtraction are nearly the same. You can represent complex numbers in a 2dimensional plane(complex plane):[\]

[t]There you can determine the value(distance to point 0) of a complex number with the pythagorean theorem:[\]
	[f]|z| = (a^2 +b^2 )^0.5 [\]
[t]Potentials of complex numbers are like potentials of normal numbers:[\]
	[f]z^n  = z*z*z*...(n times)[\]
	[f]z^-n  = {1}/{z*z*z*...(n times)}[\]
[t]If n is a natural number. For z^1/n  its just the nth root of z like in normal exponential functions. The main difference in calculation is the root. For that you need the polar coordinates form:[\]
[p]1/plane2.png[\]
	[f]z = r*cos(&f)+i*r*sin(&v)[\]
[t]Now you also need to know:[\]
	[f]cos(x)^n  = cos(xn)[\]
	[f]sin(x)^n  = sin(xn)[\]
[t]The nth root has this exponent: 1/n. The nth root of a complex number always has n possible solutions:[\]
	[f](rcos(&v)+irsin(&f))^1/n  = r^1/n (cos((&f+2&pv)/n)+isin((&v+2&pv)/n))[\]
[t]v is defined as integer number 0≤v<n. For each v there is one solution. All solution form a regular polygon with n sides on the complex plane.\Roots like this create quantum numbers.\Euler's formula can be applied to complex numbers, too:[\]
	[f]e^z  = e^a *(cos(b)+isin(b))[\]
