[t] An imaginary number is the product of the imaginary unit(i, which is the square root of -1)and any real number. Imaginary numbers are part of complex numbers which are just compositions of imaginary and real numbers. Generally they can be written as:\[\]
	[f]bi = b*√-1√ [\]
[t] Imaginary numbers can be optained by roots of negative numbers or as logarithm of a negative number. For calculating with exponents of imaganary units its important to know how the imaginary unit acts. The following equations show the different options:\[\]
	[f]i^n*4+0  = 1[\]
	[f]i^n*4+1  = i[\]
	[f]i^n*4+2  = -1[\]
	[f]i^n*4+3  = -i[\]
[t] Where n is a non negative integer number. As you might see is the 5th root of i = i.\Important about imaginary numbers is Euler's formula:\[\]
	[f]e^xi  = cos(x)+isin(x)[\]
[t] x is any real number. This formula is very important for the creation of a wave using Schrödinger's equation.\[\]
