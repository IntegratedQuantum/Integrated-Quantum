[t]Differential equation are equation which shows the connection between a function and one or more of its derivatives. A simple equation is:[\]
	[f]af+ {df}/{dx} = 0[\]
[t]f is a function of x.\a is a constant or a function of x.\
Now we can bring the equation into another form which makes it easier to solve it:[\]
	[f]{df}/{dx} = -af[\]
	[f]{df}/{f} = -adx[\]
[t]Now we need to integrate and bring f to one side:[\]
	[f]∫{1}/{f} df = ∫-adx[\]
	[f]ln(f)+c_1  = ∫-adx[\]
[t]The rightern part depends on the function a. If a is a constant:[\]
	[f]ln(f)+c_1  = ax+c_2 [\]
	[f]c = c_2 -c_1 [\]
	[f]ln(f) = ax+c[\]
[t]Now we put the equation in the exponent of e:[\]
	[f]f = e^ax+c  = Ae^ax [\]
    [f]A = e^c [\]
[t]So this was the simplest differential equations. The constants can being determined by known conditions like points from the function(or its derivatives). If you have equations like the Schrödinger equation it comes very complex using integration:[\]
	[f]af+{d^2 f}/{dx^2 } = 0[\]
	[f]{d^2 f}/{dx^2 } = -af[\]
	[f]{d^2 f}/{f} = -adx[\]
	[f]∫∫{d^2 f}/{f} = ∫∫-adx[\]
	[f]∫ln(f)+c_1 df = ∫-ax+c_3 [\]
	[f]fln(f)+c_1 f-f+c_2 = -0.5ax^2 +c_3 x+c_4 [\]
[t]You can see there are many unknown constants and there is a big problem with the part fln(f). The solution of this equation cannot being found that easy. But there is another method to solve this kind of differential equations:[\]
	[f]{d^2 f}/{dx^2 } = -af[\]
[t]In this equation you can see that the second derivative of f is proportional to f. There is only one type of functions which is proportional to its derivative: exponential functions. So you can substituate f as e^kx  and calculate this to get the constant k.[\]
	[f]ae^kx +{d^2 e^kx }/{dx^2 } = 0[\]
[t]Now you have to form and insert the derivative of e^kx :\[\]
	[f]ae^kx +k^2 e^kx  = 0[\]
[t]You have e^kx  in every term and the e^kx  is never 0 for finite k. So you can remove this part because it cannot be the cause of the 0.[\]
	[f]a+k^2  = 0[\]
	[f]k^2  = -a[\]
[t]Now you need to root the equation and get k:[\]
	[f]k = ±√-a√[\]
[t]For a = 1 the root of -a equals to i the imaginary unit.[\]
	[f]k = ±i[\]
	[f]f_1  = c_1 e^ix [\]
	[f]f_2  = c_2 e^-ix [\]
[t]c_1  and c_2  are unknown constants which are caused because the calculation above leads to the same result with any c_1 or c_2. The function f is given as:[\]
	[f]f = f_1 +f_2 [\]
	[f]f = c_1 e^ix +c_2 e^-ix [\]
[t]Applying to Euler's identity:[\]
	[f]e^ia  = cos(a)+isin(a)[\]
	[f]f = c_1 (cos(x)+isin(x))+c_2 (cos(x)-isin(x))[\]
	[f]f = (c_1 +c_2 )cos(x)+i(c_1 -c_2 )sin(x)[\]
[t]Now we can redefine c_1  = c_1 +c_2  and c_2  = ic_1 -ic_2 :[\]
	[f]f = c_1 cos(x)+c_2 sin(x)[\]
[t]Even this method can become very complex with more and more functions and derivatives of the main function. For these the best thing is to let software do your work.[\]
