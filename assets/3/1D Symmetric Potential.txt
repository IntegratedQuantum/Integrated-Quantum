[r]Requirements: Ħconstant PotentialĦ2ĦSolving the schrödinger equation for constant potentialĦ[\]
[t]Solving the schrödinger equation numerically is very easy in one dimension. The wave function can be divided into small pieces which each has an almost constant potential. This assumption guarantees an error in the result which varies in size depending on how big the small pieces of the potential are. For every small interval there is a wave function which is derived from the schrödinger equation in constant potential, i is included in k:[\]
[f]&Y_n (x) = A_n *e^k(n)*x  + B_n *e^-k(n)*x [\]
[f]k(n) = i* {√2m(E-V(nΔx+0.5Δx))√}/{ħ}[\]
[t]n is the number of the interval starting at n = 0 and Δx is the width of each interval. So every interval assumes the potential of the middle of the interval to be constant over the whole interval. At the transition point between 2 intervals (n*Δx) the corresponding wave functions must have equal values and equal derivatives:[\]
[f]A_n-1 *e^k(n-1)*x  + B_n-1 *e^-k(n-1)*x = A_n *e^k(n)*x  + B_n *e^-k(n)*x [\]
[f]A_n-1 k(n-1)*e^k(n-1)*x  - B_n-1 k(n-1)*e^-k(n-1)*x = A_n k(n)*e^k(n)*x  - B_n k(n)*e^-k(n)*x [\]
[t]Assuming A_0  and B_0  are known every following A and B can be calculated from the previous ones. If the linear equation system above is solved for A_n  and B_n  then the needed equations for the numerical solution are yielded:[\]
[f]A_n  = 0.5*({A_n-1 e^k(n-1)*x }/{e^k(n)*x } *(1 + {k(n-1)}/{k(n)}) + {B_n-1 e^-k(n-1)*x }/{e^k(n)*x } *(1 - {k(n-1)}/{k(n)}))[\]
[f]B_n  = (A_n-1 e^k(n-1)*x  + B_n-1 e^-k(n-1)*x  - A_n e^k(n)*x )*e^k(n)*x [\]
[t]There is just one problem: A_0  and B_0  are not known. This problem can be solved by just assuming symmetry. If the potential function is symmetric then the wave function has to be symmetric or antisymmetric. That means:[\]
[f]&Y_n  = ±&Y_-n [\]
[t]If the first interval is from -0.5Δx to 0.5Δx which is reached by n = -0.5, 0.5, 1.5,... the wave function would need to be a cosine for the symmetric and a sine for the antisymmetric case. When working with euler's formula[\]
[f]e^ix  = cos(x)+i*sin(x)[\]
[t]it is obvious that for the wave function the relation between A_0  and B_0  is A_0  = ±B_0  .\The value for A_0  can be chosen freely. After the calculation the wave function can be normalized by dividing every A and B by the numerical integral of the resulting wave function over the given interval. This app also includes the corresponding program that solves the schrödinger equation as described here.[\]
